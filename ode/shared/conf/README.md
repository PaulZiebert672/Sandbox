_Kepler problem_
: the two-body problem in celestial dynamics

#### cr3bp

_Circular restricted 3-body problem_
: the circular restricted 3-body problem in celestial dynamics (co-rotating frame of reference)

#### vdpo

_Van der Pohl oscillator_
: the model of a generator on a triode for a tube with a cubic characteristic

#### lorenz

_Lorenz attractor_
: system of ODE notable for having chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and initial conditions

#### lv

_Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model_

#### mp

_Mathematical pendulum_
: the simple physical system that allows analytic solution

#### dpm

_Double pendulum (mathematical)_
: the simple physical system that exhibits rich dynamic behavior with a strong sensitivity to initial conditions
