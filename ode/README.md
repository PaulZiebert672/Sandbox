# ODE problems

[Double pendulum](double_pendulum/README.md)
: the simple physical system that exhibits rich dynamic behavior with a strong sensitivity to initial conditions

[Kepler problem](kepler_problem/README.md)
: the two-body problem in celestial dynamics

[Circular restricted 3-body problem](cr_3-body_problem/README.md)
: circular restricted 3-body problem in celestial dynamics

[Mathematical pendulum](mathematical_pendulum/README.md)
: the simple physical system that allows analytic solution

[Pendulum on tube](pendulum_on_tube/julia/problem.md)
: not so simple physical system similar to the mathematical pendulum
